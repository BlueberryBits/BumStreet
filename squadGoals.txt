# Goals of Bum Street
# 1) Make me more money than chase which results in a nice burrito
# 2) Notify Me when a stock is within 5% of a new all-time high
# 3) Compile all pertinent SEC documents (Quarterly reports for the last 6 Quarters)
# 4) Neatly show how EPS has changed for the last few years
# 5) Compare P/E ratio to price trends?

Alt Goals.
# 1) Beat the S&P. 
	-The S&P is the enemy and we must destroy it with dope ass gains.
# 2) the S&P500 is our greatest assest
	-To limit the amount of data we need to pull though APIs we will take comfort in the fact that the companies of the S&P are there for a damn good reason. 
# 3) calculate the covariance of stocks in the S&P (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covariance.asp)
# 4) Be alerted when price of a stock apears to be oversold
	-This will be done by comparing P/E with other companies in its same sector.
	-Data will need to be adjusted to take into account as many variables as possible
